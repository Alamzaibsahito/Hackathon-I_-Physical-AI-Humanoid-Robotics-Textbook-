Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond purely software-based solutions to encompass intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. This field is crucial for developing autonomous robots, intelligent agents, and humanoid systems that can perform complex tasks, adapt to dynamic environments, and collaborate with humans. As AI systems become more sophisticated, their ability to perceive, reason, and act in the physical domain becomes paramount for real-world deployment.
