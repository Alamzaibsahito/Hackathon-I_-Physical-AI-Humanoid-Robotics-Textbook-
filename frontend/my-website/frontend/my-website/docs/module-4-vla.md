### Week 14-16: VLA Model Fundamentals

*   **Topics:** Vision-language models (VLMs), action generation, foundation models in robotics, prompt engineering for robotics, few-shot learning.
*   **Hands-on:** Integrating pre-trained VLA models with simulated robots, generating action sequences from natural language commands, fine-tuning VLA models for specific tasks.
