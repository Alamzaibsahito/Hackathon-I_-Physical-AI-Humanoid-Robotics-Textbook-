## Navigating Your Learning Journey

This textbook is designed to be interactive and practical. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, guiding you through increasingly complex topics in physical AI and humanoid robotics. We recommend following the chapters sequentially, but feel free to jump to specific sections if you have prior knowledge in certain areas. Practical exercises and code examples are provided throughout the book to reinforce learning.

To make the most of this textbook, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of Python programming and fundamental robotics concepts. The code examples are primarily in Python, leveraging popular robotics frameworks like ROS 2. Setting up your development environment as described in the hardware requirements chapter will be crucial for hands-on learning.

### Textbook Structure
*   **Foundational Concepts:** Chapters 00-01 introduce the core ideas of physical AI and how to use this book.
