## Understanding Physical AI

Physical AI refers to the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on intelligent systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting with the physical world. Unlike purely software-based AI, physical AI embodies intelligence in robotic systems, enabling them to perform tasks in real-world environments. This involves a combination of advanced perception, cognition, and actuation capabilities, allowing robots to adapt and learn from their physical surroundings.

Key aspects of physical AI include robust sensor integration for perceiving the environment, sophisticated control algorithms for manipulation and locomotion, and AI models that can reason about physical properties and cause-and-effect relationships. The goal is to create autonomous agents that can safely and effectively operate alongside humans in various domains, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and exploration.

### Core Components of Physical AI
*   **Perception:** Utilizing sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and depth sensors to understand the environment.
*   **Cognition:** AI models for decision-making, planning, and learning from experience.
*   **Actuation:** Robotic hardware and control systems for physical interaction and movement.
*   **Interaction:** Mechanisms for safe and effective collaboration with humans and other agents.
